					<h4>Tom, on Sara:</h4>
					<p>Sara has turned her intelligence, curiosity, and creativity into a career researching and writing articles for a large number of magazines and periodicals. With her love of history, literature, and the arts, we've created so many memories attending concerts, visiting museums, and exploring the beautiful outdoors around her hometown of Wilmington. We both love traveling off the beaten path and look forward to making more memories all over the world. Sara brings out the best in me, and I'm thrilled to spend the rest of my life with this amazing woman.</p>

					<h4>Sara, on Tom:</h4>
					<p>Tom is a talented web designer who loves geeking out on all things web design and computer. He is an avid Philly sports fan who enjoys playing recreational football on the weekends. He shares his musical gifts on the worship team at church and I especially love hearing his beautiful tenor voice serenading me in the car. Tom is a kind, patient man who makes every day an adventure. We look forward to sharing our mutual love of history, the arts, and travel in the years together as husband and wife.</p>
